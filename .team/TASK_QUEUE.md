## 🚀 Active Sprint: Security Hardening & Internal Pilot

### Task 1: Fix IP Protection (Standalone Script Mode)
- **Assignee:** Antigravity
- **Status:** `[DONE]`
- **Resolution:** Added `SPREADSHEET_ID` property and updated `ss_()` to call `SpreadsheetApp.openById()`. Code can now run as a standalone script in FIDIT's Drive, completely hidden from clients.

### Task 2: Fix Race Conditions on Telegram Callback Actions
- **Assignee:** Antigravity
- **Status:** `[DONE]`
- **Resolution:** Wrapped `setOrderStatus_()` with `LockService.getScriptLock()` with a 20-second timeout. `advanceOrderStatus_` is also protected.

### Task 3: Commit & Push Full Codebase to GitHub
- **Assignee:** Antigravity
- **Status:** `[TODO]` — committed locally, **not pushed**. Push remains Antigravity's call per protocol.
- **Note from Claude Code:** commits `b09bbfa`, `32f9329`, `2bd763b` and `<this one>` are on `main`
  locally. See Task 5 for the protocol deviation this represents.

### Task 5: Audit Remediation, Test Harness & CI
- **Assignee:** Claude Code
- **Status:** `[READY_FOR_AUDIT]`
- **Commits:** `b09bbfa`, `32f9329`, `2bd763b`, plus the lock-coverage commit below.

**Delivered**
1. **Six critical defects fixed** (see AUDIT_LOG Audit 3): silent save failures, reminders that
   could never fire, dead `handleCallbackQuery`, order-id collisions, Telegram alerts dropped on
   Markdown-breaking names, and an unauthenticated endpoint.
2. **Operations features:** kitchen status pipeline (Confirmed → Cooking → Out for Delivery →
   Delivered), automatic chasing of unpaid balances, weekly CSV backup to Drive + email, and a
   `Settings` tab so timings are owner-editable.
3. **Test harness in `test/`** — 142 checks, `node test/run.js`, zero packages, plus CI on every
   push via `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.
4. **`onEdit` integrity guard** — repairs Delivery Date / Time / Phone when edited by hand, which
   is what keeps the reminder engine working after a human touches the sheet.
5. **`reportNewErrors`** — pushes new `Log` rows to Telegram, so failures stop being silent.

**Points for the auditor's attention**
- ⚠️ **Protocol deviation:** commits `32f9329` and `2bd763b` went to `main` directly rather than a
  branch. My earlier branch had already been folded into `main` between sessions and I did not
  re-check before committing. Nothing is pushed. Rebase onto a branch if you want them isolated.
- ⚠️ **`ADR 001` needs a ruling.** The suite adds no npm packages and ships nothing to the client,
  but running it requires Node. If "no Node" is meant to cover tooling as well as runtime, say so
  and the harness comes out.
- 🔴 **`markOrderPaid_` was unlocked** while `setOrderStatus_` was locked in `d97bdab`, despite the
  identical read-then-write-five-cells shape. Fixed in `2bd763b`.
- 🟠 **Lock-coverage audit against the TEAM_STATE rule.** Every sheet writer was checked. One real
  gap: `onEdit` → `repairOrderCell_` ran outside any lock and has no locked caller — now takes a
  short `tryLock`, deliberately non-blocking because it fires while a person is typing.
  `upsertCustomer_`, `logError_` and `pruneBackups_` are **intentionally** unlocked: they are only
  called from inside locked functions, and Apps Script script locks are not reentrant, so locking
  them would deadlock. Each now carries a comment saying so.
- 🟠 **Two test defects found and fixed while writing the suite:** an assertion that depended on the
  wall clock (passed by day, failed after ~22:30), and order ids that were only *probabilistically*
  unique. Ids are now checked against those already issued.

### Task 6: Verify the live bot end-to-end
- **Assignee:** Umair (Product Owner)
- **Status:** `[TODO]`
- **Bot:** `@royal_catering_orders_bot` (id `8856703286`)
- **Spec:**
  - Run `setupProperties()` then `registerWebhook()`, then `runSelfTest()`.
  - Confirm the alert rings, and that **Mark as Delivered** both updates the sheet and edits the message.
  - Install all five triggers from `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` Step 5 (four timed; `onEdit` needs none).
  - ⚠️ Never paste the bot **token** into chat or into any file — Script Properties only.
    The bot id and username above are public identifiers and safe to record here.

### Task 4: Internal Staging Setup on FIDIT Accounts
- **Assignee:** Umair (Product Owner)
- **Status:** `[TODO]`
- **Spec:**
  - Follow `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` using your own personal Telegram & FIDIT Google account.
  - Run `runSelfTest()` in Apps Script and verify the test message rings your Telegram.
